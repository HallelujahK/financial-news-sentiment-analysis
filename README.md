# Financial News Sentiment Analysis

This repository is dedicated to a comprehensive analysis of financial news data to discover correlations between news sentiment and stock market movements. The project is part of a challenge designed to refine skills in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to enhance Nova Financial Solutions' predictive analytics capabilities by performing a rigorous analysis of a large corpus of financial news data. By analyzing the sentiment of news headlines and correlating it with stock price movements, the project aims to uncover actionable insights that can inform investment strategies.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to derive sentiment scores from financial news headlines. These scores will help quantify the emotional tone of the news and its potential impact on stock prices.
  
- **Correlation Analysis:** Establish statistical correlations between the derived sentiment and stock price movements. This will involve time-series analysis and the exploration of causal relationships between news sentiment and market reactions.

- **Investment Strategy Suggestions:** Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for investment strategies that leverage the relationship between news sentiment and stock price fluctuations.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project, the Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID), combines both qualitative and quantitative data, including:

- **Headline:** The title of the financial news article.
- **URL:** The direct link to the full article.
- **Publisher:** The source or author of the news article.
- **Date:** The publication date and time (UTC-4 timezone).
- **Stock:** The stock ticker symbol associated with the news article.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a structured format to ensure organization and modularity:
- **src/**: Source code for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping.
- **tests/**: Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the codebase.
- **scripts/**: Standalone scripts for various tasks such as data cleaning and model training.
- **.github/**: Configuration files for Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.
